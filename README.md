python3

Written in pyton v3.7+ -- be sure to download the latest code/binaries : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have python make a text file on your desktop ( or folder if you want a codes folder, however it will take slight navigation.)

Once you have a blank text file save the code in ctof.py as whatever you want, i prefer something short and easy to type , just make sure to include the file extension .py so it knows how to be interpreted. 

Open windows powershell (or cmd line works too just powershell is easier to navigate IMO) - 

type ls - this will list the contents of the directory powershell is operating out of .. example:

PS C:\Users\vulca> ls


IF you created a folder for your new files you will need to change directory to this folder now

First we will need to change to Desktop

Type: cd Desktop (cap D)

new output: 
PS C:\Users\vulca> cd Desktop
PS C:\Users\vulca\Desktop>

PS C:\Users\vulca\Desktop> ls


i have re listed my files, here my folder is called git. i change to git. 

inside git is only ctof.py

i type python3 ctof.py ( you can type python3 c tab and it will tab to complete) in powershell cmd line .. this should run as a python script and will prompt you with the question you see in the code if you open it up ( right click and "edit with IDLE") Feel free to make any changes to the wording. I would like to find a way to put it on a repeating loop so i dont have to re run the line of code everytime even. 
HOWEVER - after you run this once if you keep powershell or cmd line open and press the up arrow on keyboard it will return your last command.. in our case python3 ctof.py
